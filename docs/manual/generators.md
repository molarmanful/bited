Generators automate the tedious process of compositing glyphs from individual
pieces. bited comes with the following generators:

| Name       | Glyphs                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| sexify     | Sextants (2x3)           |
| sepsexify  | Separated Sextants (2x3) |
| octify     | Octants (2x4)            |
| braillegen | Braille (2x4)            |

The [Query Spellbook](../finder/query-spellbook) contains Finder queries to
retrieve the glyph pieces necessary for each generator to work. Once you've
finished drawing the pieces, press the generator's button and bited will draw
the rest of the glyphs for you.
