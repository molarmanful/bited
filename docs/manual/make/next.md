# What's Next?

It is at this point that the design of `unicorn` is entirely in your hands; you
are free to add or modify glyphs to your heart's content. Here is a recommended
"roadmap" for expanding the font:

- Uppercase letters
- ASCII (in Windows Glyph List 4, this encompasses glyphs up to `~`)
- ISO-8859-1 (in Windows Glyph List 4, this encompasses glyphs up to "Ã¿")
- Windows Glyph List 4
- *And beyond...*

For reference, here's [:material-download: my version of
unicorn](../assets/unicorn.bdf){download="unicorn.bdf"}. It covers all of
ISO-8859-1 and includes some extra symbols from Windows Glyph List 4 to cover
common punctuation and symbols.
