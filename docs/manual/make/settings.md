# Settings

After opening up `unicorn` and getting to the Main Screen, the first thing we'll
do is open the Settings Menu (++ctrl+comma++). Verify that it's on the FONTS
tab.

!!! tip

    Hover over each settings field's label to get more information about that field!

???+ question "foundry name"

    By default, this is `bited`. Feel free to change this to something more
    personalized if you wish.

???+ question "family name"

    By default, this is `new font`. Let's change this to `unicorn`.

!!! note

    If you didn't choose a preset when creating the font, the following metrics
    fields will be `0`.

???+ question "Metrics"

    Let's set:

    - Default dimensions to width `7` and height `17`.
    - Descent to `4` (ascent will automatically update accordingly).
    - Cap height to `9`.
    - X-height to `5`.

Once you've finished changing the settings, save & close (++ctrl+enter++) to go
back to the Main Screen.
