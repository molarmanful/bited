# Preview

We now have a whole word's worth of glyphs drawn out, but how do we see these
glyphs in action?

In the Navbar, press the "preview font" button (++ctrl+p++).

Type "adhesion" into the input, and you should see the fruits of your labor
thus far!

    Preview comes with several text presets that may come in handy as you
    continue designing your font and adding more glyphs.
