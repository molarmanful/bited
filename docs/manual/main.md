# Main Screen

From the Start Menu, let's load the `bited` font we imported previously.

??? tip "Hint"

    To load existing fonts from the start screen, press the "load" button
    (++2++).

In the table with a bunch of glyphs, find the "b" glyph and double-click it.

The Main Screen consists of several panels (from left to right, top to bottom):

???+ question "Editor"

    A place to draw and manipulate individual glyphs. Features visual markers
    representing font metrics.

???+ question "Table"

    A view of glyphs in the currently selected Tree. Used to select and
    manipulate multiple glyphs, or send individual glyphs to the Editor.

???+ question "Tree"

    A nested list of character sets ("charsets") and encodings. You can switch
    between entries here to find or focus on groups of glyphs that you wish to
    edit.
