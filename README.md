## Overview

**bited** (pronounced "bit" + "ed") is an open-source designer and editor for
bitmap/pixel fonts -- specifically monochrome Unicode BDF fonts. It features a
coterie of small yet impactful quality-of-life goodies that aim to make the
creative process smooth and enjoyable for the type designer. Some of these
features include:

- Simple, composable tools for drawing and manipulating glyphs.
- Font preview with text presets for testing fonts.
- Custom UI fonts made with bited.
- Light and dark mode.
