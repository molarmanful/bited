## Overview

**bited** is an open-source designer and editor for bitmap/pixel fonts --
specifically monochrome Unicode BDF fonts. It features a coterie of small yet
impactful quality-of-life goodies that aim to make the creative process smooth
and enjoyable for the type designer. Some of these features include:

- Simple, composable tools for drawing and manipulating glyphs.
- Font preview with text presets for testing fonts.
- Custom UI font made with bited.
- Light and dark mode.

bited is still undergoing heavy development; any bugs should be reported to
[Issues](https://github.com/molarmanful/bited/issues).
